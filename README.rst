=============================
Mantis IODEF Importer
=============================

**WARNING: Mantis is not maintained anymore: by now, the excellent MISP platform
(http://www.misp-project.org/)
offers all the functionality (and much more) that had been required when
MANTIS was created but could then not be found in any other tool.**



An IODEF (v1.0) importer for the  Mantis Cyber Threat Intelligence Mgmt. Framework.

The basic layout for this Django app with out-of-the-box configuration of ``setup.py`` for
easy build, submission to PyPi, etc., and Sphinx documentation tree was generated with Audrey Roy's excellent `Cookiecutter`_
and Daniel Greenfield's `cookiecutter-djangopackage`_ template.
